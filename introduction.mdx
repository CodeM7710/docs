Warden is a highly customizable, free Discord moderation bot with built-in, state-of-the-art antiraid features that, together, is all you need to keep your server safe and enjoyable for you and your members, so that you can leave that to Warden and deal with the fun and growth of your server!

Here's a quick overview of some things Warden can help you with in your server:

* Warden is equipped with a detailed punishment system for your server's moderators to use, complete with default punishment tracks, punishment commands, user warnings, profile censors, and more!

* A state-of-the-art, built-in antiraid system that helps automate moderation and isolation of things like spamming, raiding, trolling, and other uncool rule-breaking things.

* A customizable modmail system that seamlessly allows server members to privately contact server staff with questions, inquiries, concerns, suggestions, reports, and more!

* An appeal system that allows punished users to get a second chance by submitting an appeal to your server's staff for their punishment to be removed.

* and much more!
